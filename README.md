The purpose of this research is to take a crucial step towards developing technology that assists high school students in learning how to write chemical formulas. Our goal is to create a smartphone application that can analyze handwritten chemical equations and provide feedback based on their accuracy and writing style. The application will be designed to simplify the learning process and optimize it for each individual student.\\

To achieve this, the application will go through several key steps. The first step involves converting the handwritten formula into a digital equation for analysis. Next, the equation will be examined against chemical standards and the correct answer to identify any errors. In the third step, personalized feedback will be provided, taking into account the student's proficiency level and addressing the identified mistakes. Finally, the developed logic will be incorporated into an engaging and enjoyable learning system, transforming the application into an interactive tool.\\

The focus of this report centers on the initial step of converting the handwritten formulas into digital equations for analysis. To achieve this, a comprehensive library of images featuring handwritten chemical formulas will be collected. This library will serve as a resource for training algorithms or evaluating the accuracy of existing algorithms. Various algorithms will then be tested for their precision and speed to determine the most suitable candidates for application development. This exploration will address the research question, "How can we effectively convert handwritten chemical formulas into digital equations for analysis?"
